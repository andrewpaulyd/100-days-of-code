# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the first hald of Applied visual design in FreeCodeCamp. Joined #100daysofCode challenge, and signed up for a udemy course on programming. 

**Thoughts:** I am an absolute beginner and this is all very confusing. Even my typing feels sluggish and inaccurate. I worry about completing anything meaningful and will continue to rely on FreeCodeCamp and the Udemy course. Not sure how to link to work just yet. 


### Day 2: January 11, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the applied design section of FreeCodeCamp, moved on to Applied Accessibility Challenges. Each day I hope to increase my general knowledge of coding and programming. Through my Git a Web Developer Job course in Udemy I learned how to code using the command line, sort of, and subsequently downloaded a text editor. 

**Thoughts**:  As I'm doing this without connection to a community the progress is slow going. Figuring out the most basic things, like using Git and a text editor has been challenging. For now I am committed to working at least one hour day and welcome any learning and growth that comes. 


### Day 3: January 12, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
